# Factors that Affect Duration of Rides in Bike-Sharing System
## by Chidubem Nwodo


## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a ford bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It has 16 columns and 183412 entries. After the cleaning of the Dataset and addition of new variables it contains 174875 entries, and 20 columns.

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration phase, my variable of interest was the duration of rides in seconds. I observed that there are factors which affects the duration of rides. Those factors include the member age, member gender, and user type (Customer or Subscriber). The members who are older had less ride duration than younger members and the 'Other' gender tends to have more ride durations than the male and female gender. Also the Customers had more ride durations than the subscribers. Most of the bike-sharing users are young members. I plan on bringing this findings into my explanatory presentation.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of the three variable member_age, user_type, and member_gender. I start by showing the distribution of duration_sec variable, followed by the pattern in member_age distribution, the relationship between duration and member age, then the relationship between duration and the categorical variables (user_type and member_gender).
